        <h4><em>e.  Feedback you provide:</em></h4>
        <p>We value hearing from our users, and are always interested in

        <h2 id="tools">3. Tools for Site Owners</h2>
        <h4><em>a. Site Features.</em></h4>
        <p>We offer products that web sites and developers can use to 
offer Pinterest features and functionality to their users (e.g., the 
“Pin It” and “Follow” buttons) (“Site Features”). You agree to use Site 
Features only as documented by Pinterest, and in compliance with our 
policies and branding guidelines. You may not place Site Features on a 
site or service with content that would violate these Terms if displayed
 on our Products. You also agree that the Pinterest features and 
functionality provided by our Site Features will be provided solely by 
our Site Features, except as otherwise authorized by Pinterest.</p>
        <h4><em>b. Permissions.</em></h4>
        <p><em>i. By incorporating Site Features into your site or 
service, you agree that Pinterest may collect and use information from 
you and your users as described in our Privacy Policy.</em>  You also 
agree that Pinterest may use automated methods to analyze your site or 
service where Site Features have been incorporated.</p>
        <p><em>ii. Some Site Features allow you or your users to post or otherwise make available content in our Products.</em>
 By using these Site Features you give Pinterest and its users 
permission to such content as set forth in Section 2(b).  Nothing in 
this Section shall restrict other legal rights Pinterest may have to the
 content.</p>
        <h2 id="copyright">4. Copyright Policy</h2>
        <p>Pinterest has adopted and implemented the 
Pinterest&nbsp;Copyright Policy&nbsp;in accordance with the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act. For more information, please read our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pinterest.com/_/_/about/copyright/" target="_blank">Copyright Policy</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="security">5. Security</h2>
        <p>We care about the security of our users. While we work to 
protect the security of your content and account, Pinterest cannot 
guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
 security measures. Please notify us immediately of any compromise or 
unauthorized use of your account. For accounts created on behalf of a 
company, organization, or other entity, you are responsible for ensuring
 that only authorized individuals have access to the account.</p>
        <h2 id="thirdparty">6. Third-party Links, Sites and Services</h2>
        <p>Our Products may contain links to third-party websites, 
advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities 
that are not owned or controlled by Pinterest. We do not endorse or 
assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, 
materials, products, or services. If you access any third party website,
 service, or content from Pinterest, you do so at your own risk and you 
agree that Pinterest will have no liability arising from your use of or 
access to any third-party website, service, or content.</p>
        <h2 id="termination">7. Termination.</h2>
        <p>Pinterest may terminate or suspend this license at any time, 
with our without cause or notice to you. Upon termination, you continue 
to be bound by Sections 2, 3(b), and 7-13 of these Terms.</p>
        <h2 id="indemnity">8. Indemnity</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Pinterest and its 
officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, 
suits, proceedings, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, 
costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and 
accounting fees (including costs of defense of claims, suits or 
proceedings brought by third parties), in any way related to (a) your 
access to or use of our Products, (b) your User Content, or (c) your 
breach of any of these Terms.</p>
        <h2 id="disclaimers">9. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The Products and all included content are provided on an “as is” basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.</p>
        <p>PINTEREST SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND 
CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR
 USAGE OF TRADE.</p>
        <p>Pinterest takes no responsibility and assumes no liability 
for any User Content that you or any other user or third party posts or 
transmits using our Products. You understand and agree that you may be 
exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate
 for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.</p>
        <h2 id="liability">10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PINTEREST SHALL NOT 
BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR 
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED 
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER 
INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR 
INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCTS; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF 
ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD 
PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR 
TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL PINTEREST’S AGGREGATE 
LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE PRODUCTS EXCEED THE GREATER OF 
ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO 
PINTEREST FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS FOR THE PRODUCTS.</p>
        <h2 id="arbitration">11. Arbitration</h2>
        <p>For any dispute you have with Pinterest, you agree to first&nbsp;<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/anonymous_requests/new" target="_blank">contact us</a>&nbsp;and
 attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If Pinterest has not
 been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to 
resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for 
injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection 
with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American 
Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules 
and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in 
effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Pinterest 
agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where 
you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, 
administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except 
that Pinterest will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and 
arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is
 non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall 
include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable 
costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award 
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent 
jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from 
seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters
 related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access 
to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL 
CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS 
OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE 
ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE 
THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND PINTEREST ARE EACH WAIVING 
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
        <h2 id="jurisdiction">12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each 
agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in
 Santa Clara County, California or the United States District Court for 
the Northern District of California, for any actions not subject to 
Section 11 (Arbitration).</p>
        <p>Our Products are controlled and operated from the United 
States, and we make no representations that they are appropriate or 
available for use in other locations.</p>
        <h2 id="general">13. General Terms</h2>
        <p><em>Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms.</em>&nbsp;
 Pinterest reserves the right to determine the form and means of 
providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices 
electronically if we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to 
time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. 
If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you. 
By continuing to access or use the Products after revisions become 
effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not 
agree to the new terms, please stop using the Products.</p>
        <p><em>Assignment.</em>&nbsp;These Terms, and any rights and 
licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, 
but may be assigned by Pinterest without restriction. Any attempted 
transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
        <p><em>Entire Agreement/Severability.</em>&nbsp;These Terms, 
together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional 
agreements you may enter into with Pinterest in connection with the 
Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and 
Pinterest concerning the Products and supersede any prior terms you have
 with Pinterest regarding the Products. If any provision of these Terms 
is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to 
the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these 
Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
        <p><em>No Waiver.</em>&nbsp;No waiver of any term of these Terms
 shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any 
other term, and Pinterest’s failure to assert any right or provision 
under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or 
provision.</p>
        <p><em>U.S. Government Agencies:</em> If you are a United States federal government agency, <a href="https://help.pinterest.com/entries/22787291" target="_blank">this amendment</a> applies to these Terms.</p>
